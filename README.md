'npm run serve' will only be used if i have any changes to the bot (the bot will go offline in a while)

CMD's so far (slash and prefix both works)
- greet (for testing the verification success embed) = ADMIN ONLY
- avatar (getting the user's avatar)
- PREFIX ONLY: .rr make (creating an reaction role) = ADMIN ONLY
- PREFIX ONLY: .songnotes/.sn <group> (song notes and duration infos)

type only cmd
- reqs (just in case someone wants to ask for requirements again even after they got verified)
